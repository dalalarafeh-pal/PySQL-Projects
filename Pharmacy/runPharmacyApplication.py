 # countNumberOfCustomers (myConn, thePharmacyID):
 # The Purchase table tells us about purchases made by a customer (customerID) in a pharmacy (pharmacyID).
 #
 # Besides the database connection, the countNumberOfCustomers function has one parameter, an
 # integer, thePharmacyID.
 #
 # countNumberOfCustomers counts the number of different customers that the pharmacy with thePharmacyID has,
 # based on the number of different customerID values that appears in the Purchase table.
 #
 # countNumberOfCustomers returns that value.
 #
 # For more details, including error handling and return codes, see the Lab4 pdf.

# updateOrderStatus (myConn, currentYear):
# In the OrderSuppy table, the value of status is either 'dlvd' (delivered), 'pndg' (pending), or 'cnld' (cancelled).
#
# Besides the database connection, updateOrderStatus has another parameter, currentYear, which is an integer.
# If currentYear is between 2000 and 2030 (inclusive), then updateOrderStatus should append ' AS OF <currentYear>' at the end of the status value
# if status is not 'cnld'.
# Other values of currentYear are errors.
#
# updateOrderStatus should return the number of orders whose status values were updated.
#
# For more details, including error handling, see the Lab4 pdf.

# deleteSomeOrders (myConn, maxOrderDeletions):
# Besides the database connection, this Python function has one other parameter,
# maxOrderDeletions, which is an integer.
#
# deleteSomeOrders invokes a Stored Function, deleteSomeOrdersFunction, that you will need to
# implement and store in the database according to the description in Section 5.  The Stored
# Function deleteSomeOrdersFunction has all the same parameters as deleteSomeOrders (except
# for the database connection, which is not a parameter for the Stored Function), and it returns
# an integer.
#
# Section 5 of the Lab4 tells you which orders to delete and explains the integer value
# that deleteSomeOrdersFunction returns.  The deleteSomeOrders Python function returns the
# the same integer value that the deleteSomeOrdersFunction Stored Function returns.
#
# deleteSomeOrdersFunction doesnâ€™t print anything.  The deleteSomeOrders function must only
# invoke the Stored Function deleteSomeOrdersFunction, which does all of the work for this part
# of the assignment; deleteSomeOrders should not do any of the work itself.
#
# For more details, see the Lab4 pdf.
